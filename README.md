Rensoft Hosting is a Windows server management tool, which allows server administrators to create new websites on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 with support for IIS 7, FileZilla FTP, and ISC BIND DNS. Using a wizard, administrators can create an IIS virtual server, FTP account and DNS zone with a few clicks. Websites can then be updated and removed using the website editor. Configuration is stored in an XML file, making for an easy setup.
